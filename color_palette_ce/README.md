For Odoo Community Version 11.0, this module replaces the default Odoo CE color & background with a single gray image background. By replacing the image file in this module, you can further personalize your Odoo CE color & background app page. This is a very simply module. It serves as an ideal example for those who are learning how to build modules with Odoo. or you want to change your own color just go to color_palette/static/src/css/color_change.css and do change for whatever color you want to change
